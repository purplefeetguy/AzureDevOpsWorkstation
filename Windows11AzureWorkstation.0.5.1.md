Annex 1: WSL2 Configuration Differences - Windows Home vs Windows Pro
Windows 11 Home Edition
- WSL2 support is fully available on Windows 11 Home (Version 21H2 or later), but lacks Hyper-V Manager.
- Virtualization must be enabled in BIOS/UEFI.
- Uses "Virtual Machine Platform" instead of Hyper-V.
- WSL2 automatically uses the Windows Subsystem for Linux architecture without additional VM configuration.

Enable WSL2 on Home Edition:
wsl --install


Check WSL2 version:
wsl --status


Windows 11 Pro Edition
- Includes Hyper-V and advanced VM management tools.
- Full support for "Virtual Machine Platform" and "Hyper-V Platform".
- Ideal for advanced scenarios like nested virtualization, Docker Desktop with Hyper-V backend, and heavier VM workloads.

Enable WSL2 on Pro Edition:
wsl --install


(Optional) Enable Hyper-V Features:
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Hyper-V-All /all /norestart

î·™î·š
Validate WSL2 Kernel Version:
wsl --status


Summary of Differences
| Feature | Windows Home | Windows Pro | 
| Hyper-V Manager | Not Available | Available | 
| WSL2 Kernel | Supported | Supported | 
| VM Management | Basic | Advanced | 
| Ideal For | Lightweight Dev | Advanced Dev / VM Scenarios | 



Annex 2: Docker Troubleshooting in WSL2
Symptom: Docker Won't Start or Returns Strange Errors
Docker requires systemd enabled for service management inside WSL2 Ubuntu.
Solution: Enable systemd
Edit /etc/wsl.conf:
[boot]
systemd=true


Steps:
wsl -d Ubuntu
sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf
# Add [boot]\nsystemd=true
exit
wsl --shutdown
wsl
ps -p 1 -o comm=


Expected Output:
systemd


Restart Docker:
sudo service docker start


Test:
docker run hello-world


### integrate the details below into the document above

Hereâ€™s a detailed summary of everything weâ€™ve worked on over the last 10 hours, including the steps taken, commands used, and explanations for each change:

---

### 1. **Hyper-V Firewall Settings and Configuration**

**Objective**: Adjust the firewall settings for Hyper-V to allow inbound connections for WSL2-based services and containers.

- **Initial State**: Hyper-V default firewall settings were blocking inbound connections.
  
**Steps Taken**:
- We ran the following command to enable inbound connections on Hyper-V VM interfaces:
  ```powershell
  Set-NetFirewallHyperVVMSetting -Name '{40E0AC32-46A5-438A-A0B2-2B479E8F2E90}' -DefaultInboundAction Allow
  ```
  This change was made to ensure WSL2 could accept traffic from external sources.

- **Why**: This allows WSL2-based Kubernetes or Docker services to be accessed from the Windows host, necessary for testing services and running containers.

---

### 2. **Docker Desktop Configuration for Kubernetes**

**Objective**: Ensure that Docker Desktop was correctly configured to allow Kubernetes and services running within Docker Desktop to be accessible from WSL2.

- **Command** to verify Docker Desktop context:
  ```bash
  kubectl config get-contexts
  ```

- **Reason**: To ensure that we had the correct context for interacting with Kubernetes in Docker Desktop, especially when switching contexts between Minikube and Docker.

- **Outcome**: We successfully ensured the context was set to `docker-desktop`, allowing Kubernetes in Docker Desktop to be accessed via `kubectl`.

---

### 3. **Minikube Configuration and Testing**

**Objective**: Set up and test a Minikube cluster in WSL2 for local Kubernetes workloads.

- **Command** to set Minikube's context:
  ```bash
  kubectl config use-context minikube
  ```

- **Command** to check nodes in Minikube:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

- **Issue**: The `kubectl` command was failing with connection errors, likely due to network issues related to the VM used by Minikube (inside WSL2).

- **Fix**: We investigated and ultimately needed to update the kubeconfig file with the correct context after network-related changes in Hyper-V and Docker.

---

### 4. **Minikube Network and Connectivity Issues**

**Objective**: Ensure connectivity between WSL2 (Ubuntu) and the Kubernetes services exposed through Minikube.

- **Issue**: Minikube was unable to establish connections to services, even though they were exposed.

- **Actions Taken**:
  - We verified the status of services running with:
    ```bash
    minikube service list
    ```
  - Checked port forwarding configurations to ensure traffic routing.
  - **Discovered** that Minikube uses its own IP address and exposes services on specific ports, requiring us to open those ports on Windows and WSL2.

---

### 5. **DNS Tunneling for WSL2**

**Objective**: Set up DNS tunneling to enable WSL2 to bypass certain network restrictions and improve compatibility with services (e.g., VPNs).

- **Command** to enable DNS tunneling in `.wslconfig`:
  ```ini
  [wsl2]
  dnsTunneling=true
  ```

- **Why**: Enabling DNS tunneling ensures WSL2 uses a more compatible DNS configuration when running on networks with complex setups, like VPNs. This helps prevent issues where DNS queries fail within WSL2 when certain networking restrictions exist.

---

### 6. **Auto Proxy Setup in WSL2**

**Objective**: Configure WSL2 to use Windows proxy settings.

- **Command** to enable Auto Proxy in `.wslconfig`:
  ```ini
  [wsl2]
  autoProxy=true
  ```

- **Why**: This ensures that any proxy configuration set in Windows is automatically mirrored within WSL2, allowing for consistent network access when behind a corporate firewall or when using proxy services.

---

### 7. **Kubeconfig and Context Management**

**Objective**: Ensure that Kubernetes contexts for Minikube and Docker Desktop are correctly set up and merged into the kubeconfig file.

- **Commands to manage Kubernetes contexts**:
  - Switch to a specific context:
    ```bash
    kubectl config use-context minikube
    ```
  - View all available contexts:
    ```bash
    kubectl config get-contexts
    ```

- **Reason**: We had to ensure the right context was selected and persisted in the kubeconfig file. This required merging contexts from Docker Desktop and Minikube into the config.

- **Issue**: We faced challenges with the kubeconfig file not properly containing all necessary contexts or configuration data. Using:
  ```bash
  kubectl config view --raw > ~/.kube/config
  ```
  helped export the correct settings.

---

### 8. **Final Validation Steps**

**Objective**: Validate all changes and ensure all services and contexts were correctly set up.

- **Testing Commands**:
  - Verify connectivity and service exposure in Minikube:
    ```bash
    kubectl get services
    minikube service list
    ```

- **Why**: To ensure the Kubernetes clusters (Docker Desktop and Minikube) are reachable and functioning as expected from within WSL2.

---

### 9. **Clearing and Rebuilding Configuration**

**Objective**: Fix kubeconfig issues by clearing and rebuilding configuration files.

- **Command** to clear any conflicting or broken configurations:
  ```bash
  kubectl config unset current-context
  kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
  ```

- **Why**: This was necessary to reset the kubeconfig file and prevent conflicts between the different Kubernetes contexts, ensuring Minikube and Docker Desktop could both be properly managed.

---

### 10. **Final Network Testing**

**Objective**: Ensure that all network configurations (e.g., Hyper-V, Docker, WSL2) were working as expected, and that Kubernetes services were exposed and accessible.

- **Commands for testing connectivity**:
  ```bash
  curl http://127.0.0.1:<port>
  ```
  - Ensured that services running in Minikube were reachable from the host machine via the browser or curl commands.

---

### **Summary of Changes**:
- **Hyper-V firewall** settings were adjusted to allow inbound traffic for WSL2 services.
- **Docker Desktop Kubernetes** context was correctly set up to allow interaction with Kubernetes from WSL2.
- **Minikube Kubernetes** cluster was initialized and tested, with fixes made for network-related issues.
- **DNS tunneling** was enabled to ensure proper DNS resolution within WSL2, improving compatibility with networks and VPNs.
- **Auto Proxy** settings were configured to automatically use Windows' proxy settings in WSL2.
- **Kubeconfig** was managed and merged to handle multiple Kubernetes contexts (Minikube and Docker Desktop).
